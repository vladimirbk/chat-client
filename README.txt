Simple chat client

First semestral work for 4IT353 course.

In order to use application start it via Client.jar file. Also, make sure that server for chat application
runs on port 5000.

After running application, type in your username in a text input located in top-left part of the screen, and
click connect. In the right part of the application you can see online users list and chat rooms list. In order
to chat with some user simply click on his name and send a message via input in the bottom part of the application.
In order to send a message to a chat room click on a chat room name and continue with the same steps' sequence.

Upon receiving a message from a certain user or in a chat room, user's name or chat room name will be highlighted
therefore indicating that you have unread messages.

I hope this thorough and excessive description will help you in using our application.
